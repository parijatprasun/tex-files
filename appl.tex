\opening{Sir,}

In response to your advertisement in the ``Times Ascent'' dated November 23, 2005, I beg most respectfully to present myself as a candidate for the position of Lecturer in the department of Electrical Engineering.

I have completed my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College, Jalpaiguri -- 735 102 with 84.3\% in aggregate and I am presently in the final year of my M.E. in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Power Systems at Bengal Engineering \& Science University, Shibpur.

As to experience, I have worked as a part-time teacher at Jalpaiguri Goverment Engineering College for one academic year before the commencement of my M.E. course.

I am enclosing my complete curriculum vitae with this letter for your kind perusal and look forward to hearing from you.

Thanking you,

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
